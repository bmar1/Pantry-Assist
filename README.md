##  Objective
This project, 'plated' aims to serve those who are on a budget or want help tracking what they eat — from calories to trying new foods — all in a way that’s easy to manage through the app, so you can spend more time doing what’s important to you!

---

## Getting started

Currently, plated is only hosted with EC2, full stack, however if you'd run it yourself you need:
- AWS RDS, EC2 instances
- Pg Admin
- API keys relevant (Walmart, with public/private keys, MealDB, Nutrionix which is now deprecated)

  ### 💻 To run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmar1/Plated.git
npm install
npm start
```

## ⚙️ Features

###  Grocery Tracking / Planning
This application, based on your requirements and use cases, adapts to help you find interesting meals while providing grocery prices in your local area via Walmart’s data.

###  Meal Planning
Need help tracking how many calories you eat or what exactly you’re eating? Say no more! Plated easily tracks your weekly meals in a clean, organized format, to make sure you never overeat.
