##  Objective
This project, 'plated' aims to serve those who are on a budget or want help tracking what they eat — from calories to trying new foods — all in a way that’s easy to manage through the app, so you can spend more time doing what’s important to you!

---

## Why use it?

Plated offers a simple solution to everyday issues, meal planning and buying groceries. Instead of spending more time figuring out what to get, just get a meal plan on us, and only buy the groceries and cook the delicious meals!

---

## Getting started

Currently, plated is only hosted with EC2, full stack, however if you'd run it yourself you need:
- AWS RDS, EC2 instances
- Pg Admin
- API keys relevant (Walmart, with public/private keys, MealDB, Nutrionix which is now deprecated)

  ### 💻 To run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmar1/Plated.git
npm install
npm start
```
